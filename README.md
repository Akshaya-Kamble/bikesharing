# Bike sharing  data using Tableau

## Overview of the analysis: 
With the analysis of NYC bike sharing data and visualization we have to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. For this analyis we will create various visualizations on Tableau.Using Pandas we will convert the datatype of tripduration to datetime dataframe and convert the numeric values of gender to string values.These pre converted columns will speed up the visualizations rather than doing the conversions on Tableau and plotting the data.

This graph shows the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.The trip duration is shown in hours.
Looking at the graph we can conclude that the most number of bikes were rented for the five hour trip duration.
